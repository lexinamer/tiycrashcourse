<h2>The Cool Cat </h2>
<p>The Cool Cat is one who doesn't care. He can often be found wearing aviator glasses, sporting a radical haircut, and hanging out in local coffeeshops. He only drinks craft beer.</p>

<h2> The Lazy Cat </h2>
<p>The Lazy Cat can be found sitting on porches all day long. She is always up for a long brunch and will bring the best snacks to parties. She also really needs a haircut.

<h2>The Hairless Cat </h2>
<p>The Hairless Cat is the one who will always ask to borrow your sweater. She hates winter and would rather go to the dentist than live in a place where it snows all the time. Pro tip: scarves make the best gifts.</p>

<h2>The Sleeping Cat </h2>
<p>The Sleeping Cat's ability to fall asleep literally anywhere will both impress and drive you nuts. While you fidget all night on a red eye from the west coast, he will get an amazing 8 hours sleep. Damn you, Sleeping Cat. Damn you.</p>

<h2>The Kitty Cat </h2>
<p>The Kitty Cat might be the most purrfect cat of all. Her real name is Rue but everyone calls her Kitty. She belongs to Lexi and loves to curl up in your lap and take a snooze. When left alone, she turns into a tiny terror.</p>
